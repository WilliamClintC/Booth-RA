### Data Cleaning

#### Shape and Column Analysis
We begin by checking the structure and columns of the dataset to ensure consistency. The data contains 47,776 rows and 12 columns, including variables such as `weight`, `year`, `age`, `education`, `race`, `asset_total`, `asset_housing`, `debt_total`, `debt_housing`, and `wealth`. For our analysis, we focus on the variables relevant to wealth and asset calculations, and note that `sex` and `income` are not used further.

| Column Name      | Type     | Description                        |
|:-----------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| `weight`         | float64  | Survey weight                      |
| `year`           | int64    | Survey year                        |
| `age`            | int64    | Age of respondent                  |
| `sex`            | object   | Sex (not used in analysis)         |
| `education`      | object   | Education level                    |
| `race`           | object   | Race/ethnicity                     |
| `asset_total`    | float64  | Total assets                       |
| `asset_housing`  | float64  | Housing assets                     |
| `debt_total`     | float64  | Total debts                        |
| `debt_housing`   | float64  | Housing debts                      |
| `income`         | float64  | Income (not used in analysis)      |
| `wealth`         | float64  | Calculated wealth                  |

#### Missing Values Check
A review of the dataset shows that there are no missing values in any column, so no imputation or removal of rows is necessary.

#### Data Types and Ranges
Below are the observed data types and value ranges:

| Variable        | Type     | Min           | Max              |
|:----------------|:---------|:--------------|:-----------------|
| `weight`        | float64  | 0.20          | 31,115.82        |
| `year`          | int64    | 1989          | 2016             |
| `age`           | int64    | 17            | 95               |
| `sex`           | object   | 2 unique      |                  |
| `education`     | object   | 3 unique      |                  |
| `race`          | object   | 4 unique      |                  |
| `asset_total`   | float64  | -22,487,306.62| 2,928,346,179.67 |
| `asset_housing` | float64  | 0.00          | 182,642,128.63   |
| `debt_total`    | float64  | 0.00          | 293,486,997.64   |
| `debt_housing`  | float64  | 0.00          | 44,821,081.33    |
| `income`        | float64  | 0.00          | 351,958,858.31   |
| `wealth`        | float64  | -221,985,489.24| 2,929,687,834.52 |

#### Negative Values Check and Cleaning
We identify that `asset_total` contains 7 negative values, which is about 0.01% of the data. Since assets cannot logically be negative, we set all negative values in `asset_total` to zero. This adjustment ensures that all asset values are non-negative, as required by financial logic. After this cleaning step, `asset_total` has a minimum value of zero, and no negative values remain.

| Variable         | Negative Values | % of Total |
|:-----------------|:----------------|:-----------|
| `weight`         | 0               | 0.00%      |
| `asset_total`    | 7 (before)      | 0.01%      |
| `asset_total`    | 0 (after)       | 0.00%      |
| `asset_housing`  | 0               | 0.00%      |
| `debt_total`     | 0               | 0.00%      |
| `debt_housing`   | 0               | 0.00%      |
| `income`         | 0               | 0.00%      |

A table of the rows with negative `asset_total` values (before cleaning) is available in the appendix or supplementary materials.

A summary table of `asset_total` after cleaning:

| Statistic         | `asset_total`      |
|:------------------|:-------------------|
| Min               | 0                  |
| Max               | 2,928,346,179.67   |
| Negative Values   | 0                  |

#### Outlier Detection
We also check for outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method. While some variables have a notable number of outliers, these are retained for analysis unless they are logically impossible (such as negative assets, which have already been addressed).

| Variable        | Outliers (N) | % of Total | Lower Bound   | Upper Bound   |
|:----------------|:-------------|:-----------|:--------------|:--------------|

| 2016 | 6,248 |

### Wealth Variable
We define the `wealth` variable using the following formula:

$$
	\text{wealth} = \text{asset\_total} + \text{asset\_housing} - \text{debt\_total} - \text{debt\_housing}
$$

This formula is applied after cleaning `asset_total`, ensuring that all asset values used in the calculation are non-negative and logically consistent for further analysis.

### Weight Variable

We also make use of the weight variable in the following way:

1. NaN values are removed from both the values and weights arrays.
2. The values and weights are sorted by value.
3. The cumulative sum of the sorted weights is computed.
4. The total weight is divided by 2 to find the "median weight."
5. The function finds the first position (index) where the cumulative weight meets or exceeds the median weight.
6. The value at this position is the weighted median entry. If the cumulative weight at that index exactly equals the median weight, the weighted median is the average of the value at that index and the next one. Otherwise, it is simply the value at the found index.

In other words, the weighted median is the value in the sorted data where the cumulative sum of weights first reaches at least half the total weight. This ensures that the weighted median reflects the distribution of the variable in the population, accounting for the importance (weight) of each observation.

Mathematically, the weighted median $m$ of a set of values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ with corresponding non-negative weights $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ is defined as the value $m$ such that:

$$
\sum_{i: x_i < m} w_i \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i: x_i > m} w_i \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i
$$

That is, $m$ is the smallest value for which the cumulative sum of the weights of all values less than $m$ is at most half the total weight, and the cumulative sum of the weights of all values greater than $m$ is also at most half the total weight.

### Findings


#### Stark housing wealth divide
- In 9 out of 10 survey years, more than half of Black households had zero median housing wealth.
- White households maintained substantial median housing wealth ($93K–$162K) throughout.

#### Persistent homeownership gap
- White households: average homeownership rate 72.8% (range: 70.5%–75.7%)
- Black households: average homeownership rate 45.6% (range: 42.2%–50.4%)
- The homeownership gap (27.2 percentage points) has remained stable for nearly three decades.
- This gap is a major barrier to wealth accumulation for Black families.

#### Housing wealth among homeowners
- Among homeowners, the racial gap narrows but persists.
- In 1989, White homeowners had 1.7× the housing wealth of Black homeowners; in 2016, this ratio was 1.6×.
- Both groups saw strong growth: +43% for White homeowners, +49% for Black homeowners.

#### Growth patterns
- White households experienced steady housing wealth growth (1.24% annually), peaking during the 2004–2007 housing boom.
- Black households showed a volatile pattern, with most years at zero median housing wealth.
- The 2008 financial crisis affected both groups, but White households recovered more fully.

#### Economic cycle impact
- During the 2001–2007 boom, both groups saw housing wealth increases.
- The 2007–2010 crisis brought sharp declines for both groups.

- 2007 Peak: White: $124,371 | Black: $40,299
- 2010 Crisis: White: $110,643 | Black: $23,720
- 2016 Recovery: White: $144,730 | Black: $29,540

##### Loss in Housing Wealth (2007)

Dollar Terms:

- White: $231,603 → $193,433 = –$38,170
- Black: $173,702 → $132,639 = –$41,063
- Black homeowners had the largest dollar loss ($41,063 vs. $38,170).

Proportional Terms (% Loss):

- White: –16.5%
- Black: –23.6%
- Black homeowners also had the largest proportional loss.

##### Summary

- Both Black and White homeowners aged 25+ experienced significant declines in housing wealth during the financial crisis (2007–2010).
- Black homeowners had the largest loss in both dollar terms and proportional terms.
- By 2016, neither group had fully recovered to 2007 levels, but White homeowners recovered a greater share of their losses.


## Many potential channels have been identified for explaining the wealth

### Hypothesis 1: Workplace Income Discrimination

One key mechanism by which discrimination widens racial wealth gaps is through **income labor discrimination**. Persistent disparities in income make it more difficult for Black households to accumulate assets or manage debt as reliably as White households. 

#### Longitudinal Analysis of Income Variation

- Use longitudinal datasets such as the *Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)* to measure year-to-year income and income by race.
- Estimate income outcome coefficients, controlling for education, occupation, experience, sex, and location.
- This approach isolates the contribution of discrimination to income differences, above and beyond observable characteristics.

#### Event Study Strategy

- Compare firms, industries, or states with **inclusionary policies** (e.g., diversity initiatives, pay transparency laws) to those with **exclusionary practices** (e.g., documented discrimination cases).
- Include a **neutral group** of firms or states as a control.
- Estimate effects on income controlling for race. A triple-difference specification,
  $$(\text{Inclusionary} - \text{Exclusionary} - \text{Control}),$$
  provides stronger identification, while a simpler difference (Exclusionary vs. Non-exclusionary) serves as a robustness check.

#### Expected Contribution

By focusing on income $β$ coefficient across different policy environments, this approach highlights how workplace discrimination affects income. The key test is whether inclusive versus exclusionary environments produce systematically different income patterns across racial groups. 

### Hypothesis 2: Disparities in the Transmission of Investment Knowledge

Another important mechanism sustaining the racial wealth gap is **unequal transmission of investment knowledge**. Even among households with similar incomes and access to financial products, Black parents may be less likely to transmit financial knowledge—such as saving habits or familiarity with financial instruments like 401(k)s—to their children. These differences in financial literacy and exposure to sound financial advice can generate divergent wealth trajectories.

#### Intergenerational Transmission of Financial Knowledge

- Construct a dataset linking parents and children (e.g., using the PSID or other intergenerational surveys).
- Use indicators of parental financial sophistication (e.g., whether parents have a 401(k), stock holdings, or savings rate).
- Test whether parental financial sophistication predicts children’s financial sophistication.
- Estimate a triple-difference specification:
  \begin{align*}
    & \Big( \text{Black w/ financially active parents} \\
    & \quad - \text{Black w/o financially active parents} \Big) \\
    & - \Big( \text{White w/ financially active parents} \\
    & \quad - \text{White w/o financially active parents} \Big)

- This identifies whether financial knowledge is transmitted differently across racial groups, which could be a driving force behind the wealth gap.
- Additionally, examine whether the savings rate of parents is similarly transmitted to children, controlling for race.

#### Neighborhood Transmission of Financial Knowledge

This analysis can be extended to the neighborhood level. Children may acquire financial knowledge not only from parents but also through neighborhood connections.
- Measure neighborhood financial sophistication (e.g., share of households with retirement accounts, stock ownership, or savings rate).
- Test whether Black individuals in financially sophisticated neighborhoods experience high levels of financial sophistication. This may be an important observation, given that white-majority, financially sophisticated neighborhoods may not necessarily transmit financial sophistication to minority Black members of the neighborhood.
- Compare whether these neighborhood effects operate equally for Black and White households, using the same triple-difference estimator as above.

#### Expected Contribution

By separately identifying family-based and neighborhood-based channels, and testing whether these operate differently by race, we can assess how much of the wealth gap is driven by **differences in transmission of financial knowledge** that affect asset holdings.

### Assessing the Importance of Each Channel

To evaluate the importance of these channels, we can extract the coefficients from our income labor discrimination estimates. This would give us a dollar amount that we can use to evaluate the magnitude of our estimates and their relation to overall wealth. These coefficients would also be helpful in comparing against other estimates academics have produced.

Next, with regard to the financial sophistication transmission channel, we can use these estimates to obtain coefficients that measure the financial sophistication associated with neighbor or family transmission. To assess the importance of these, we would create an additional test examining whether individuals with greater financial sophistication tend to have higher asset holdings. This can be done using a simple regression, controlling for age, race, gender, etc., with financial sophistication as the independent variable and assets as the dependent variable. The coefficient from this regression would identify asset increases associated with higher financial sophistication. This provides a dollar estimate to assess the magnitude and importance of financial literacy, and thus the significance of the financial sophistication transmission channel. Furthermore, this is a well-studied area, so other academic papers can be referenced to benchmark the magnitude and importance of financial sophistication for asset accumulation.

Finally, we can compare our estimates to findings from other academic studies, while also checking for statistical significance and robustness.
